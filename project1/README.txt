We were tasked, for this project, to create a simple web API using Flask.
It uses the same premise as the midterm, with taking in simulated stock information to return an average.
It also requires that the data is given in a CSV format.

How to use the scripts:
  python stox_api.py
  
  python q_upload.py "path to the CSV files to upload"
